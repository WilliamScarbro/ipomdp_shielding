Distributionally Robust Partially Observable Markov Decision
Process with Moment-based Ambiguity
Hideaki Nakao∗ Ruiwei Jiang† Siqian Shen

Addresses Interval POMDPS but avoids belief envelope construction by allowing access to the true state at the end of each step.
Uses two player game (with nature playing interval realization) to solve Bellman equaitons for IPOMDP
