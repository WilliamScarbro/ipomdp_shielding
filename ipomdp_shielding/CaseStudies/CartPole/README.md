# CartPole Case Study

This case study demonstrates **vision-based perception shielding** for the CartPole-v1 environment. A CNN estimates the 4D continuous state (position, velocity, pole angle, angular velocity) from consecutive frame pairs, and we build an IPOMDP to provide safety guarantees under perception uncertainty.

## Key Features

- **Continuous State Space**: 4D state (x, ẋ, θ, θ̇) discretized into 7 bins per dimension = 7^4 = 2,401 states
- **Vision-Based Perception**: CNN trained on frame pairs to estimate state
- **Factored Perception Model**: Independent perception models per dimension combined via product
- **Empirical Dynamics**: MDP learned from 10,000+ gymnasium rollouts
- **Safety**: Within CartPole-v1 termination bounds (|x| ≤ 2.4, |θ| ≤ 12°)

## Usage

### 1. Generate Data

First, generate the required data files by running:

```bash
python -m ipomdp_shielding.CaseStudies.CartPole.data_preparation
```

This will:
1. Collect frame pairs and states from CartPole-v1 (200 episodes)
2. Train a CNN to predict state from frames (20 epochs)
3. Generate confusion matrices for each state dimension
4. Collect empirical dynamics (10,000 episodes)
5. Save all data to `lib/` directory

**Note**: This requires `torch`, `torchvision`, and `gymnasium` to be installed.

### 2. Build IPOMDP

```python
from ipomdp_shielding.CaseStudies.CartPole import build_cartpole_ipomdp

# Build IPOMDP with default parameters
ipomdp, pp_shield, test_data = build_cartpole_ipomdp(
    confidence_method="Clopper_Pearson",
    alpha=0.05,
    train_fraction=0.8,
    num_bins=7,
    smoothing=True,
    seed=42
)

print(f"States: {len(ipomdp.states)}")  # 2402 (2401 + FAIL)
print(f"Actions: {len(ipomdp.actions)}")  # 2
print(f"Shield entries: {len(pp_shield)}")
```

### 3. Test Perception Bounds

Validate that the perception model's interval bounds cover empirical test frequencies:

```bash
python -m ipomdp_shielding.CaseStudies.CartPole.cartpole_model_test
```

This will:
- Split data into train/test (80/20)
- Build IMDP from training data
- Compute empirical frequencies on test data
- Report violation rate (should be ≤ α = 5%)

### 4. Run Evaluation

```python
from ipomdp_shielding.CaseStudies.CartPole import cartpole_evaluation

# Run evaluation with exact belief propagation
ipomdp, pp_shield, test_data, rtips = cartpole_evaluation()
```

## Design Decisions

### State Space Discretization

**7 bins per dimension** provides:
- Manageable state space (2,401 states)
- Sufficient granularity for safety predicates
- Alignment with existing CartPole thresholds

Bin edges are computed from training data to cover the observed range.

### Factored Perception Model

We **assume independence** between dimension errors, which:
- ✅ Reduces 7^4 × 7^4 joint confusion matrix to 4 × 7×7 matrices
- ✅ Makes belief propagation computationally tractable
- ⚠️ May underestimate correlated errors (conservative)

The factored model is constructed as:
```
P(x', ẋ', θ', θ̇' | x, ẋ, θ, θ̇) = P(x'|x) × P(ẋ'|ẋ) × P(θ'|θ) × P(θ̇'|θ̇)
```

### Empirical Dynamics

Dynamics are learned by:
1. Running 10,000 random-policy episodes in gymnasium
2. Discretizing continuous states into bins
3. Counting transitions: N[(s, a, s')]
4. Normalizing to probabilities: P(s'|s,a) = N[(s,a,s')] / Σ_s' N[(s,a,s')]

**Unobserved transitions** are filled with self-loops (conservative).

### Safety Predicate

A state is **safe** if:
- |x| ≤ 2.4 (cart position)
- |θ| ≤ 0.209 radians (pole angle ≈ 12°)

We use **one-step lookahead**: action `a` is safe from state `s` if all reachable next states are safe.
